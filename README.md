Abstract: With the advancements in denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), image inpainting has undergone a significant evolution, transitioning from filling information based on nearby regions to generating content conditioned on various factors such as text, exemplar images, sketches, etc. However, existing methods often necessitate fine-tuning of the model or concatenation of latent vectors, leading to drawbacks such as generation failure due to overfitting and inconsistent foreground generation. In this paper, we argue that the current large models are powerful enough to generate realistic images without further tuning. Hence, we introduce PILOT (in**P**ainting v**I**a **L**atent **O**p**T**imization), an optimization approach grounded on a novel semantic centralization and background loss to identify latent spaces capable of generating inpainted regions that exhibit high fidelity to user-provided prompts while maintaining coherence with the background region. Crucially, our method seamlessly integrates with any pre-trained model, including ControlNet and DreamBooth, making it suitable for deployment in multi-modal editing tools. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches by generating more coherent, diverse, and faithful inpainted regions to the provided prompts.

## Getting Started
It is recommended to create and use a Torch virtual environment, such as conda. Next, download the appropriate PyTorch version compatible with your CUDA devices, and install the required packages listed in requirements.txt.
```
git clone https://github.com/Lingzhi-Pan/PILOT.git
cd PILOT
conda create -n pilot python==3.9
conda activate pilot
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can download the `stable-diffusion-v1-5` model from the website "https://huggingface.co/runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5" and save it to your local path.

## Run Examples
We provide three types of conditions to guide the inpainting process: text, spatial controls, and reference images. Each condition-control refers to a different configuration in the directory `configs/`.

### Text-guided
Modify the `model_path` parameter in the config file to point to the directory where you saved your SD model, and then execute the following instruction:
```
python run_example.py --config_file configs/t2i_step50.yaml
```

### Text + Spatial Controls
To introduce spatial controls using ControlNet or T2I-Adapter, we offer options for both models, but we recommend using ControlNet. First, download the ControlNet checkpoint, such as ControlNet conditioned on Scribble images, published by Lvmin Zhang from the following link: https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-scribble. Then, execute the instructions below:
```
python run_example.py --config_file configs/controlnet_step30.yaml
```
You can also download other ControlNet models published by Lvmin Zhang to enable inpainting with other conditions such as canny map, segmentation map, and normal map.

### Text + Reference Image
Download the checkpoint of IP-Adapter from the website "https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter", and then run the following instruction:
```
python run_example.py --config_file configs/ipa_step50.yaml
```
![image](https://github.com/Lingzhi-Pan/PILOT/blob/main/assets/ip_adapter_a.png)

### Text + Spatial Controls + Reference Image
You can also use ControlNet and IP-Adapter together to achieve multi-condition controls:
```
python run_example.py --config_file configs/ipa_controlnet_step30.yaml
```

### Personalized Image Inpainting
You can also integrate LORA into the base model or replace the base model with other personalized Text-to-Image (T2I) models to achieve personalized image inpainting. For example, replacing the base model with a T2I model fine-tuned by DreamBooth using several photos of a cute dog can generate the dog inside the masked region while preserving the dog's identity effectively.
